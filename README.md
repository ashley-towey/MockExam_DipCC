# MockExam_DipCC

Part A 
 
You are expected to produce a creative piece of work using the p5.js framework within a given set of constraints specified below. Beyond these constraints, you are free to include any other p5.js or JavaScript techniques, functions, or libraries to realize your creative vision. 


Technical constraints  
The following must be incorporated into your project:  

An array. 

A ‘While’ or ‘For’ Loop.  

A conditional statement (<, >, ==, >=, <=).  

A custom function (i.e. one you have written).  

Use of p5.js’ random() and/or map().  

Utilize the Weather API and make use of at least two live data values. 

Incorporate a GUI element (i.e. button or a slider) OR make use of an event (i.e. keyboard, mouse - see p5js.org/reference). 

 

Part B 
 
Write a short statement situating your p5.js project (part A) in a broader social, economic, and technical context. We are looking for between 600-800 words and encourage you to draw from the lectures, practical exercises, and inspirational work you have encountered in this unit (and across the diploma), alongside your everyday experiences of computing and network use.  

To help you write, consider there is no story too small or insignificant, as computation can be understood through multiple scales and registers. Those scales can range from the personal act of writing a ‘for loop’ to the scale of call centres, social media platforms, global migration, or a university education system. Registers to consider might include commentary on technical, aesthetic, economic, race, class, gender, institutional, ethical, or emotional associations of your project – meaning the act of writing and running code can be thought about in more than technical terms.   

In your text, we expect you to highlight examples of work that have inspired you and the ways you have built-on or leveraged, those ideas in your submitted project. Finally, we expect you to reflect on what has worked, what didn’t, what could be improved, and how your project could be extended.
